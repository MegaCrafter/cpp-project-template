# C++ Project Template
Project template for C++ projects with CMake

## Structure
The template consists of src and include directories. All cpp files in src directory are
automatically included (recursively).

There is also the outer Makefile. This lets you run cmake, build the binary, and even run
the binary with a one-line command.

The build directory is set as `out/build` but you can change it in the outer Makefile.

You should also change the project name in `CMakeLists.txt`

## Makefile
There are 4 scripts in the outer Makefile:

- `make` or `make buildall`: Runs cmake and then runs the generated makefile
- `make br`: Stands for "build & run". This will build the binary and then run it.
- `make cmake`: Runs the cmake
- `make build`: Runs the makefile generated by cmake.

### Happy Coding!
